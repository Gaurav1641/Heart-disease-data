Heart-Disease-Diagnostic-Analysis-
overview
â€¢ This project aims to uncover actionable insights from Financial Analytics data using python and its libraries. I dove deep into financial analytics, focusing on the market capitalization and quarterly sales of leading companies. By using data cleaning and preparation , Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA), key metrics calculation(mean, median) and provide actionable insights based on data trends.

This project involved several critical steps:
ETL Process: Extracting, transforming, and loading data to ensure it was ready for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the data through various statistical measures and visualizations.
Data Visualization: Creating insightful visualizations to uncover patterns and correlations in the data.
Feature Engineering: Enhancing the dataset with new features to improve model performance.
Model Building: Developing and tuning machine learning models to predict heart disease.
Evaluation and Interpretation: Assessing the models and interpreting the results to provide actionable insights.
Key Learnings and Achievements:
Developed a robust ETL pipeline to handle real-world healthcare data.
Conducted in-depth EDA to identify key trends and correlations.
Created effective visualizations that helped in the interpretation of complex data.
Built and evaluated multiple machine learning models to identify the best-performing one.
Gained practical insights into handling and analyzing healthcare data, which is crucial for real-world applications.
Tools and technology:
Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and more.
